# AquaQuiver
This is a pico-example of a Apache Arrow based meta-data driven lakehouse for Microsoft Fabric. For a full scale solution, I recommend twoday's AquaVilla best practices.

If wanting an Apache Spark based version of a meta-data driven lakehouse for Microsoft Fabric, there is also [AquaShack](https://github.com/ChristianHenrikReich/AquaShack)

## Notes

Currently, due to Microsoft Fabric, it have to run on PySpark compute instead of a Python Notebook compute.

## Installation 

/Setup.ipynb holds all to get started. It is one script, to setup the full example.

## Documentation

AquaQuiver is traditionel medallion architecture, due to history the Bronze, Silver and Gold layers are named Landing, Base and Curated.

When installed, the notebook 1_AquaShack_Landing_To_Base will move example data from Landing to Base. 
The notebook 2_AquaShack_Base_To_Curated will move data from Base to Curated.
